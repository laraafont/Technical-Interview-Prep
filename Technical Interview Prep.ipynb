    "- you can maintain relationships between indices\n",
    "- you can narrow down a search window\n",
    "- the two-pointer approach is a common technique in which we intitialize two pointer variables to track different indices or places in a list or string and move them to new indicies based on certain conditions\n",
    "- start and end pointers\n",
    "- same direction pointers\n",
    "- fast and slow pointers\n",
    "- when to use TWO POINTERS\n",
    "    - data structure: 2ptr is a technique is most commonly applied to strings, arrays, and linked lists\n",
    "    - reducing nested loops:\n",
    "    - in place operations: the 2ptr technique is often used when performing operations on a sequence in place, without creating an extra data structure to hold the result, \"removing duplicates froma sorted array\"\n",

    "- used when: the array/string is sorted (binary search)\n",
    "- used when: you're looking for pairs, sums, or symmetrical properties\n",
    "Classic Problems:\n",
    "1. Two Sum (Sorted Array)- move l and r inward depending on sum\n",
    "2. 3 Sum/ 4 Sum- fix one pointer, use two-pointer inside loop\n",
    "3. Container With Most Water- move the shorter wall inward\n",
    "4. Trapping Rain Water- track leftMax/rightMax while moving inward\n",

    "4. Longest Repeating Character Replacement- use max frequency in window to guide shrinking\n",
